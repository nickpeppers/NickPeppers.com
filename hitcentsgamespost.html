                    <p>I'm an App Developer and as of writing this post I have spent the past 4+ years working at Hitcents helping make all kinds of app/games that I definitely feel that people should at least checkout if they have the time. Most if not all of these games were built for mobile and/or pc and the majority of which are all cross platform. Some were built simply using Xamarin, others with Monogame, and some of our more recent games we created in Unity.</p>

                    <p>Draw A Stickman was one of the first games we created based on our Draw A Stickman episodes that started as a passion project by Phil Williams. The site had you draw your own stickman which would come to life and take you through a series of adventures and encounters that you had to draw your way out of. The site took off and led to us porting it to run on mobile devices, which we did by using Xamarin back in its early days. This led to later becoming a full fledged game Draw A Stickman Epic. We made the game using MonoGame/XNA and it can currently be found on almost any app store even on Windows Phone and several app stores in China.</p>
                    
                    <p>Draw A Stickman Epic 2 came about later after the first full fledged game became fairly successful. Epic 2 was a whole new adventure more brightly colored than the first with entirely new puzzles, enemies, and even more drawing to be done. It was created with Unity after we decided, instead of creating our own game engines to use and try to build upon for each different game, it would be more beneficial to spend our time learning how to use a currently more robust engine. It not only made it a bit easier for our animators to create nice animations, but still continued to allow us to make cross platform applications in C#.</p>

                    <p>Battlepillars was the one of the next game ideas that was soon brought to life. It had users creating, battling, and fighting their own battle ready caterpillars in a tug of war strategy game. This game can also be found on almost any app store, was created with MonoGame/XNA, and even featured live realtime pvp.</p>
