# nickpeppers.github.io
This is the start to my website I was creating for nickpeppers.com but couldn't host on GoDaddy for free because they suck. I copied the NickPeppers.com to make this repo since it was all jacked up with project files in dumb places. Also note the index.html must be located in the root or Github.IO won't function correctly.
